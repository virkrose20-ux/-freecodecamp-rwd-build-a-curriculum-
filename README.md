# freeCodeCamp: Build a Curriculum

My first project from the Responsive Web Design certification-completed the 11-step HTML.

## What I Learned 
- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for page hierarchy
- Paragraphs: `<p>` tags for text content
- Basic HTML structure and document flow
- Brief Introduction to JavaScript (early concepts)
